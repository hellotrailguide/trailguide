Trailguide — Focus & Profitability Anchor
What Trailguide Is (never forget this)

Trailguide is a developer-first product tour system built on the belief that onboarding should be owned, versioned, and shipped like code.

Trails are:

Defined as JSON

Stored in the application repo

Reviewed in PRs

Deployed with the app

Runnable forever without a vendor dependency

Trailguide does not try to be:

A growth platform

A product analytics suite

A behavioral tracking system

A marketing dashboard

It is infrastructure for onboarding.

The Core Philosophy (non-negotiables)

These principles should never be compromised:

Ownership over lock-in
Users always retain their trail files. Trails must run even if Trailguide Pro disappears.

Git-native by default
Trails live in repos, not dashboards. Versioning happens via Git, not hidden UIs.

Minimal runtime surface
The free runtime stays small, predictable, and boring — in a good way.

Empower non-engineers without betraying engineers
POs and designers can iterate independently, but developers control integration and deployment.

Restraint is a feature
Trailguide avoids bloated analytics, styling controls, and marketing gimmicks.

If a future feature violates one of these, it should be rejected.

The Two Products (clear line, no blur)
Trailguide Core (Always Free, Open Source)

What it is
Trailguide Core is the permanent, free foundation of the system. It provides everything needed to run tutorials in production without paying Trailguide anything.

What it does

Defines the trail JSON format

Provides the runtime that executes trails in an app

Supports step logic, targeting, progression, and completion

Allows trails to be authored or edited manually

Runs independently of any Trailguide service

Can be used forever, even without Pro

How it works

A trail exists as a JSON file in the app’s repository

The app imports and launches trails using the runtime

Trails execute client-side inside the app

Developers control when and how trails are shown

Why it’s free
Trailguide Core exists to:

Build trust with developers

Eliminate vendor lock-in

Encourage adoption

Establish Trailguide as the reference implementation

Trailguide is not monetized by runtime usage.

This is intentional.

Trailguide Pro (Paid, Proprietary)

What it is
Trailguide Pro is a trail authoring and verification environment. It dramatically reduces the cost and friction of creating, maintaining, and validating onboarding flows.

What it unlocks

Visual UI recording

Drag-and-drop step reordering

Step detail editing (copy, placement, targeting)

Live preview and testing in the real app

One-click export of validated trail JSON

Built-in trail usage and step completion visibility

What it is not

Required to run trails

Required in production

Required for developers

It exists to make trail creation faster, safer, and more accessible.

Who pays for Pro

Teams with active onboarding needs

Product owners who want independence

Designers who want confidence

Developers who want fewer interruptions

Analytics: How to Think About It (critical framing)

Trailguide analytics are not product analytics.

They are:

Trail health signals

Step completion visibility

Drop-off confirmation

Verification that onboarding ran

Analytics exist to answer:

“Did this tutorial actually help?”

Not:

“What are users doing everywhere?”

“How do we optimize conversion funnels?”

This keeps analytics:

Scoped

Privacy-friendly

Aligned with trust

Clearly a Pro value-add

Profitability Plan (simple and sustainable)

Trailguide monetizes creation, not execution.

Free: unlimited runtime usage

Paid: better authoring, faster iteration, confidence

This creates:

Low support burden

Predictable costs

Clear upgrade motivation

No hostage dynamics

Pro pricing is justified because it:

Saves engineering time

Unblocks POs

Reduces onboarding risk

Prevents broken tutorials from shipping

Trailguide never charges:

Per user

Per session

Per trail run

That’s a hard line.

What to Say in Marketing (always safe)

Use language like:

“Tutorials as code”

“Git-native onboarding”

“Own your product tours”

“Run trails from your repo”

“No vendor lock-in”

“Built for developers, usable by POs”

“Verify onboarding actually works”

Emphasize:

Ownership

Simplicity

Calm tooling

Independence

What Not to Say (important)

Avoid:

“No-code”

“Growth”

“Funnels”

“Cohorts”

“User behavior tracking”

“Conversion optimization”

“Engagement platform”

Those invite the wrong comparisons and expectations.

Trailguide is infrastructure, not marketing software.

The Mental Model to Protect

If Trailguide ever becomes:

Dashboard-first

Account-based

Metrics-driven

Style-heavy

Feature-bloated

…it has lost its identity.

The correct mental model is:

Trails are files.
Pro helps you make better files.
Core runs them forever.

One-Sentence Internal North Star

If you need a single sentence to come back to:

Trailguide exists to make onboarding feel like software, not a service.

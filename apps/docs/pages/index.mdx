# Trailguide

**Product tours as code.** Trailguide is a lightweight, framework-agnostic SDK for building guided onboarding tours directly in your web app. Define tours in JSON, target elements with CSS selectors, and ship them as part of your codebase — not as a third-party script.

```bash
npm install @trailguide/core
# or with React:
npm install @trailguide/runtime
```

```tsx
import { Trailguide } from '@trailguide/runtime'
import '@trailguide/core/dist/style.css'

const tour = {
  id: 'onboarding',
  title: 'Welcome',
  version: '1.0.0',
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'step-1',
      target: '[data-tour="dashboard"]',
      placement: 'bottom',
      title: 'Your Dashboard',
      content: 'Everything you need in one place.',
    },
  ],
}

export function App() {
  return <Trailguide trail={tour} onComplete={() => console.log('done')} />
}
```

## Why Trailguide?

Most onboarding tools are third-party scripts — loaded from a CDN, configured in a dashboard, and invisible to your version control. Trailguide is different: tours live in your codebase as JSON, ship with your deploys, and get reviewed in pull requests alongside the features they document.

| No external script tag | ✅ | ❌ |
| TypeScript types | ✅ | Sometimes |
| Works offline / in staging | ✅ | Sometimes |
| CSS selector targeting | ✅ | ✅ |
